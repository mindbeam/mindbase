# The Philosophy of Mindbase

Because of the nature of its design intent, it is utterly inevitable that the conversation surrounding Mindbase will become entwined in philosophy.

Lets declare a few key ideas here so that they may potentially serve as a lightning rod. That way, we may keep later efforts and conversations compartmentalized, and avoid the debilitating nature of untimely philosophizing.

## Convergent Intersubjective Truth

Glossary: [Intersubjective Truth](./GLOSSARY.md#truth-intersubjective)

One of the core tenets of MindBase is that truth is a construct. Lets be clear about what is meant by this. It does NOT mean both-sides-ism, nor does it mean that we can fly if we believe hard enough. Instead, it means that everything we know about the world is either incommunicable noise, OR has been parsed, packaged, symbolized, represented, and communicated in some way that is shaped by social forces. Mathematics is a great example of this. One would readily and rightly be accused of heretical crackpottery were they to argue that mainstream mathematics is anything less than the supreme law of the universe. And yet, in a sense we did not "Discover" mathematics per se, but rather constructed them. What we "discovered" was a self-consistent system of symbols and symbolic manipulation which describes, however imperfectly, some constraints of the universe.

So when we say that Mathematics are a construct, you can see how this might be seen as inflammatory without a little bit of context about what we mean.

In a similar sense, everything else that we know – All that hard-won knowledge of our forebears is also a construct – "discovered" to be self consistent, and fit the constraints of some externality, at least to a degree.

Some of these constructs are very well agreed upon. That is to say, very well converged:

* The earth is an oblate spheroid
* Water is wet between 0-100 Celsius
* 1 + 1 = 2
* Money has some kind of value

Others less so:

* The meaning of the term socialism
* Causal links between Vaccines and diseases
* Facebook's net positive influence on the world
* Differences between a protest and a riot
