/// # Claim
/// An allogation is kind of like an "Atom" of meaning. In the same way that you typically interact with molecules rather than
/// atoms in the physical world, so to do you interact with "Symbols" in the ontological world. These
/// molecules/symbols don't simply spring into existence however. Molecules must be built of atoms, and Symbols must be built of
/// Claims.
///
/// NOMENCLATURE QUESTION: Symbol/Symbol/Claim/Atom etc?
/// There must be a bifurcation between the Subjective and the Intersubjective.
/// The Subjective is actually more than just according to a person or agent.
/// It's also according to a context â€“ A time, A place, A frame of mind, An intention.
/// As such, these subjective elements are really more like events. In this sense, the term Claim is nice, because it implies
/// that provenance is involved. The question is: Is "Symbol" a nicer term for Claim? In some sense its nicer, because it
/// symbolizes some occurrent. Unfortunately it also muddies the idea of a Symbol. A symbol is also kind of a symbol, because it
/// symbolizes an "idea" (Some ontologists quibble about Symbols being bad, as "Symbol" implies that it's a thought about a
/// thing rather than a symbol of that thing)
///
/// For this reason, I've been thinking about nomenclature like:
///    Proto-Symbol (Claim) and Symbol (Symbol)
///       * Unfortunately this is muddy, because both claims and symbols are symbols
/// or Subjective-Symbol and Intersubjective Symbol
///       * unfortunately this is muddy, because Subjectivity might be wrongly taken to mean "Person"-al, rather than situational.
///
/// To the degree that you possess a "Self", so too do you possess agency over your thoughts, feelings, and perceptions.
/// Unfortunately, that's about the extent if your agency, epistemologically speaking. Much To the chagrin of narcisists
/// everywhere, they (and you) possess no agency hatsoever over objectivity or objective truth.
///
/// So whatever shall we do to make sense of the world?
///
/// In MindBase an Claim is essentially an opinion of, or measurement about the world which is attributable to a specific
/// Agent. Agents may then form `Symbols` from a collection of claims which are believed to one degree of confidence or
/// another to be referring to approximately the "same" thing
