# The plan

[X] get rid of capnp and tarpc
[X] Define minimal GRPC proto for inserting entities with properties
[ ] Hypergraph entities directly manage properties
    [X] temporarily edges
    [X] Make Hypergraph generic over symbol type
    [X] Basic String symbols
    [X] Rename weight to value.
    [ ] Property indexing (by symbol + value)
    [ ] Naive Query by property
      [ ] presumptuous value specification
      [ ] single value
      [ ] Range
    [ ] Clean up or remove the Hypergraph trait
    [ ] How are Edges handled?
       [ ] Adjacency list (remove from entity store)
       [ ] Adjacency list should be bidirectional for undirected AND directed edges
    [X] Clean up Artifact and rename to Types
    [ ] Clean up tests
    [ ] Clean up docs
    [ ] Type + property grounding. Eg: [["type","string"], "full_name"]
      [ ] query argument validation (and value parsing?)
    [ ] Restore symbol sets
       [ ] trivial symbol grounding
    [ ] MBQL via GRPC
       [ ] more sophisticated symbol grounding

[X] Add tonic to mindbase and incorporate time-series
[X] Update hubitat to insert entities into mindbase
[ ] Expand proto to query entity range by date property
[ ] Implement time series graph rendering with trailing query interval via GRPC 


19. Add tonic-web to server OR use grpc-web-client
20. Implement LRU cache for entities in the client


X. Study rocksdb index behaviors & indradb's usage of it
Y. How to remove an entity from index, without re-indexing? Look it up - duhh
