# The plan

[X] get rid of capnp and tarpc
[X] Define minimal GRPC proto for inserting entities with properties
[ ] Hypergraph entities directly manage properties
    [ ] Make Hypergraph generic over symbol type
    [ ] Each entity has N properties, each "named" by a symbol
       [ ] audit property vs edge ( property has a value, edge has an entity? )
    [ ] How are Edges handled?
       [ ] temporarily ignore them
       * ??: What if they were just properties where the value was a list of entity ids?
       * Ok: from, to gives you a directed edge. members: gives you a 
       * Weird: You have to use symbols to describe from,to, and members?
       *        that makes traversal really hard
    [X] Rename weight to value.
        [~] Rename Artifact to Value
        [X] How do we do type mapping?
           * Type mapping is purely a function of input/output. Not the Hypergraph itself
    [ ] Can Values contain symbols? or just property keys?
        - if they do, that's ok, but they won't be indexed by it
    [ ] How do we index properties? Symbol +
        - Too many indices?
        - Symbols which are similar?
        - Symbol id?

[ ] Add tonic to mindbase and incorporate time-series
[~] Update hubitat to insert entities into mindbase
[ ] Automatically create an index for each property (of which date occurred is one)
[ ] Expand proto to query entity range by date property
[ ] Implement time series graph rendering with trailing query interval via GRPC 


19. Add tonic-web to server OR use grpc-web-client
20. Implement LRU cache for entities in the client


X. Study rocksdb index behaviors & indradb's usage of it
Y. How to remove an entity from index, without re-indexing? Look it up - duhh
